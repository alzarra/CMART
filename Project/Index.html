	<hTitle> Common Questions About Recycling In Montana, What Can I Recycle? </hTitle>	<br>
	<hBody> Montana recycles mostly plastic, batteries, metal, cardboard, paper, glass, electronics, and automotive parts. Most things are safe to recycle such as metal, paper and
	glass, but some other recycables, such as plastics, are harder to recycle. This is because not all plastics are recycable. Below will list each type of material
	and a little bit of information in each that is recycable in Montana, and filterable in the Map.	
	
	<br>
	
	The types of materials that can be recycled in Montana, and that are able to be filtered on our map, include: 	<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	- Plastic										<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

	- Glass											<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	- Plastic Bags / Film / Wrap					<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	- CFLs & Tubles									<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	- Wood & Lawn Waste / Kitchen Compost			<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	- Cooking Oil									<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
